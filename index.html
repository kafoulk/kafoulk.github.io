              </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Since early 2024, I have served as the Website Manager and
              Designer for a San Francisco based class action law firm. In
              February 2025, I expanded my role to also include Digital
              Marketing Manager. My goal was simple but challenging: to build an
              integrated digital experience that converts, informs, and reflects
              the professionalism and empathy of the firm.
            </p>
            <p>
              This case study combines the full scope of my work, from
              redesigning the firm's outdated website to optimizing their
              digital advertising campaigns for lead quality and cost
              efficiency. It highlights my process, tools, insights, and
              results, emphasizing how a unified UX and marketing strategy can
              drive real impact.
            </p>

            <h3>Website Redesign: From Friction to Function</h3>

            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>
              The original website was outdated, difficult to navigate, and
              underperforming on mobile. Bounce rates were high, trust was low,
              and users could not easily find what they needed, especially those
              under stress seeking legal help.
            </p>
            <p>
              I conducted a full audit using Microsoft Clarity, Google Search
              Console, and session replays, alongside stakeholder interviews. I
              uncovered key issues including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mobile load times exceeding 6 seconds</li>
              <li>Unclear, redundant navigation structure</li>
              <li>Lack of accessibility features</li>
              <li>Development bugs showing on the front-end</li>
              <li>
                Missing trust signals such as testimonials and case results
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="example-images">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="images/cs1-example1.png"

            </div>

            <h4>Define</h4>
            <p>
              Using these insights, I created user flows, personas, and a design
              plan focused on mobile usability, accessibility, and trust. My
              goals were to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create intuitive, mobile friendly navigation</li>
              <li>Organize content logically for easy scanning</li>
              <li>Guide users through clear calls to action</li>
              <li>Meet performance and accessibility benchmarks</li>
            </ul>

                />

              </figure>
            </div>

            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p>
              After developing wireframes and high fidelity prototypes in Figma,
              I refined the site using principles of mobile-first and accessible
              design. I ensured high contrast color use, screen reader
              compatibility, and semantic HTML structure. Typography, spacing,
              and color were carefully chosen to reduce visual noise and improve
              clarity. Copy was updated in collaboration with the firm to sound
              both professional and empathetic.
            </p>

            <h4>Build and Launch</h4>
            <p>
              I rebuilt the website using WordPress with a custom theme designed
              for performance and modularity. Key improvements included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduced page load time to under 2 seconds</li>
              <li>Improved bounce rates on core service pages</li>
              <li>Increased contact form submissions</li>
              <li>Enhanced Core Web Vitals and SEO rankings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This redesign provided a strong foundation for smarter, more
              targeted digital advertising.
            </p>

            <h3>Digital Marketing: From Clicks to Clients</h3>

            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
            <p>
              Before I stepped in, the firm was spending heavily on ads but
              getting few qualified leads. The intake team was flooded with spam
              and mismatched inquiries. My goal was to improve lead quality, not
              just quantity.
            </p>

            <h4>Strategy</h4>
            <p>
              I rebuilt the marketing funnel from the ground up. I started with
              an audit of previous campaign data, then aligned messaging and
              targeting across platforms. My approach included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Competitor and keyword research using SEMrush</li>
              <li>
                Writing conversion-focused ad copy based on user pain points
              </li>
              <li>
                Designing static and video creatives for Meta, Google, and
                Reddit
              </li>
              <li>Creating case-specific landing pages with clear CTAs</li>
              <li>
                Using UTM tracking to monitor phone clicks and form submissions
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Campaign Spotlight: Class Action Lead Generation</h4>
            <p>
              For a three-week campaign targeting a class action case, I
              developed urgency-driven Meta, Reddit, and Google ads and a
              focused landing page with two options: call or submit a form.
            </p>
            <p>Focusing on just the Meta Ads, we saw the following results:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ad Spend:</strong> $600</li>
              <li><strong>Website Leads Generated:</strong> 210</li>
              <li><strong>Cost Per Lead:</strong> ~$2.80</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lead Match Rate:</strong> 94% of leads met case criteria
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This campaign became a blueprint for future outreach due to its
              high efficiency and conversion quality across all platforms.
            </p>
            <div class="example-images">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="images/cs1-example5.jpg"
                  alt="Meta Ads chart example"
                />
                <figcaption>2025 Class Action Campaign Results</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <h4>User Journey Mapping</h4>
            <p>To ensure that every campaign touchpoint aligned with user expectations, I created a detailed user journey map for prospective clients. This map was built around real behavioral insights, showing how a consumer first encounters an ad, evaluates credibility, engages with a landing page, and ultimately converts through an intake form. By breaking the experience into stages of Attract, Interact, Engage, and Convert, I was able to pinpoint emotional drivers, identify barriers, and design optimizations that guided users smoothly through the funnel. The results were clear: reduced friction, higher engagement rates, and an improved conversion flow that directly supported the campaign’s success.</p>
            <div class="example-images">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="images/cs1-example6.png"

                />

              </figure>
            </div>
            <h4>Ongoing Optimization</h4>
            <p>
              I approached every campaign as a dynamic system. I continuously
              improved performance using:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A/B testing of headlines, visuals, and CTA phrasing</li>
              <li>Mid-campaign content refreshes to reduce fatigue</li>
              <li>Refined targeting based on platform performance</li>
              <li>Conversion tracking through UTM parameters and event tags</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tools Used</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Meta Ads Manager</li>
              <li>Reddit Ads</li>
              <li>Google Analytics</li>
              <li>SEMrush</li>
              <li>Adobe Creative Cloud</li>
              <li>WordPress with custom landing pages</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Outcomes</h4>
            <p>
              As a result of these integrated efforts, the firm saw significant
              improvement in lead quality and marketing efficiency. Cost per
              acquisition went down, relevant leads increased, and intake
              processes became more streamlined. Most importantly, the team now
              has a structured, repeatable campaign process grounded in data.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              Overseeing both the website and marketing efforts allowed me to
              create a seamless, user-first experience. The redesigned website
              supported better ad performance by offering fast, focused landing
              pages. The campaigns, in turn, reached more of the right people
              with clarity and empathy. These strategies worked together to
              build a cycle of trust, action, and measurable growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project confirmed what I believe deeply: that great marketing
              is great UX. It is about understanding people, removing obstacles,
              and guiding them toward helpful outcomes. I continue to maintain
              and improve these systems, always listening to data and designing
              with care.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are looking for this kind of results-driven partnership, I
              would love to help with your next digital challenge.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              In 2023, I had the pleasure of working with a local nonprofit
              based in Auburn, Indiana, dedicated to building a stronger, more
              connected community for veterans. Their work is hands on and
              heartfelt, funded through local sporting events, merchandise
              sales, and community led initiatives. The organization is family
              owned and operated, and needed a digital presence that could
              reflect their values and serve their goals while avoiding the need
              for ongoing technical support.
            </p>
            <p>
              My role was to craft a digital brand experience that was
              approachable, easy to manage, and aligned with their mission to
              empower and serve.

            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>
              To kick off the project, I met with the founders at their physical
              location in Auburn. This in person collaboration allowed me to
              understand their daily work, the challenges they faced managing
              their digital tools, and the personal mission behind their brand.
            </p>
            <p>
              We discussed product sales, upcoming events, and long term goals.
              I also conducted on-site photography during this visit to ensure
              we had original, meaningful imagery that showcased the people and
              community behind the mission. These photos were later used
              throughout the website and printed materials to create emotional
              resonance and authenticity.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learning their goals and pain points through discussion</li>
              <li>Capturing professional on site imagery</li>
              <li>
                Observing how they interact with technology and social media
              </li>
              <li>
                Defining user needs for both audiences: supporters and internal
                staff
              </li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <h3>Define</h3>
            <p>There were four clear goals for their digital platform:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Raise awareness about fundraising events</li>
              <li>Share their story and mission with the community</li>
              <li>Sell branded merchandise to support veteran initiatives</li>
              <li>
                Maintain the website in house without ongoing developer support
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The target audience was primarily local residents aged 35 and
              older, many with military affiliations. I translated these needs
              into a strategy that focused on legibility, clarity, and emotional
              storytelling.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A clean, community centered interface</li>
              <li>
                Easy to follow site navigation for events, shopping, and mission
                pages

              <li>
                Strong trust building elements including original photography
                and testimonials

            </div>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              To ensure the nonprofit could manage the site independently, I
              selected Squarespace as the platform for its drag and drop
              interface and built in design tools. This allowed for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Quick edits to text, images, and event details</li>
              <li>Seamless e-commerce setup</li>
              <li>
                Modular content blocks that could be duplicated or removed as
                needed
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I also developed a full brand guideline system, including
              typography, colors, and logo usage. This helps maintain
              consistency across web, social, and print materials as they create
              them in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              My design priorities were rooted in accessibility and mobile
              usability. I incorporated clear call to action buttons, mobile
              optimized layouts, and intuitive content flow. Each decision was
              made to reflect the organization’s values of transparency,
              service, and pride in community.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Direct calls to action to shop or RSVP to events</li>
              <li>Real photography in banners and galleries</li>
              <li>Mobile responsive templates</li>
              <li>Clear product filtering and checkout flow</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="example-images">
              <figure>
                <img

                />
                <figcaption>Events page in desktop and mobile view</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
              After design approval, I built and launched the live site with
              e-commerce, event listings, and contact tools fully integrated. I
              also hosted a walkthrough session with the team to train them on
              content updates and product management. A digital user manual was
              provided as a reference for future changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I designed print flyers using the same branding system to support
              physical promotion at community events, extending their identity
              beyond digital spaces.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
              The nonprofit had established a professional online presence that
              reflected their story and supported their goals.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First ever branded website with e-commerce and event listings
              </li>
              <li>Consistent brand identity across web and print</li>
              <li>Backend designed for independent updates</li>
              <li>Improved community engagement and local visibility</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              This project reinforced that UX design is not only about the user
              who visits the site, but also about the person who maintains it.
              By listening to the nonprofit’s needs and building tools around
              their real capacity, I was able to deliver a solution that felt
              empowering, not overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their mission is rooted in connection. My goal was to create a
              platform that honored that mission, supported local fundraising
              efforts, and gave the team the autonomy to grow their impact
              through design that works for them.

            </div>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The Midwest Festival Website was a collaborative class project
              designed to showcase music and cultural festivals across the
              Midwest United States. The goal was to create a responsive,
              interactive website where users could explore festival details,
              purchase tickets, and download digital tickets in PDF format. We
              aimed to deliver an engaging user experience with a strong
              foundation in modern frontend design principles.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our team consisted of three students. My primary role was UX
              Designer and Frontend Developer, responsible for designing the
              interface, implementing the frontend layout and components, and
              ensuring a seamless user experience. My two teammates focused on
              setting up and maintaining the backend infrastructure, including
              the server, database, and PDF ticket generation functionality.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2 weeks</li>
              <li><strong>Team Size:</strong> 3 Students</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tools &amp; Tech:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                Node.js, SQLite, GitHub, Discord, jsPDF
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Discovery and UX Research</h3>
            <p>
              We began the project by identifying key user goals and
              functionality needs:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Highlight the unique character of Midwest festivals</li>
              <li>
                Make festival details and ticket access seamless across all
                devices
              </li>
              <li>
                Integrate dynamic functionality such as downloadable tickets
              </li>
              <li>
                Design an intuitive and fun experience for a diverse audience
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To inform our direction, we studied real festival websites to
              analyze UX patterns, navigation styles, and visual strategies.
              This led to several key design priorities:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear, mobile-friendly navigation</li>
              <li>Strong visual hierarchy using cards and carousels</li>
              <li>
                Personalized user interactions like downloadable PDF tickets
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>UX Strategy and Design Thinking</h3>
            <p>To guide the design process, I developed detailed user personas representing the primary audience for the Midwest Festival website. By centering design decisions around their goals, behaviors, and pain points, I was able to shape the site’s layout, content, and interactive elements to support intuitive exploration, seamless ticket purchasing, and meaningful engagement. Grounding the project in these user-centered insights ensured the website delivered both a fun and practical experience for diverse festival-goers.</p>
            <div class="example-images">
              <figure>
                <img src="images/cs3-example8.png" alt="emilys user persona example" />
                <figcaption>Emily's User Persona Example</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>  
            <p>
              I then approached the interface from a UX-first mindset. I mapped out
              primary user flows and interactions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Browsing Festivals:</strong> The homepage features a
                dynamic carousel of festival highlights.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Viewing Details:</strong> Clicking a card opens detailed
                festival information with dates, lineup, and location.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Getting Tickets:</strong> A clean form allows users to
                input their details and generate a downloadable PDF ticket.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Wireframes were first sketched by hand, then developed into
              responsive layouts using HTML and CSS. Every screen was designed
              with a mobile-first approach to support users on the go.
            </p>

            <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
            <p>
              My teammates built the backend architecture using Node.js and
              SQLite. Meanwhile, I was tasked with leading the frontend
              development. I built the UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
              integrating components like:
            </p>

            <h4>Frontend Highlights:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Responsive UI layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid</li>
              <li>
                Festival carousel styled to emulate a Spotify-like browsing
                experience
              </li>
              <li>
                Card-based interface pulling live festival data from the backend
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="example-images">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="images/cs3-example4.png"
                  alt="Festivals page html code example snippet"
                />
                <figcaption>

                </figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>

            <h4>Backend Features (by teammates):</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Node.js server to handle requests</li>
              <li>PDF ticket generator using a JavaScript library (jsPDF)</li>
              <li>
                SQLite database to store and manage festival and ticket data
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Collaboration Process</h3>
            <p>
              Our team worked remotely using GitHub for version control and
              Discord for communication.

                assign tasks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Branch-based Workflow:</strong> Each team member worked
                on a separate feature branch, which we merged via pull requests.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Discord Check-ins:</strong> We held daily stand-ups to
                resolve blockers and coordinate changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pair Programming:</strong> For complex challenges, we

              This project was a hands-on demonstration of collaborative UX
              design and development. It strengthened my frontend skills,
              deepened my understanding of design systems, and prepared me for
              real-world team workflows involving both design and engineering
              disciplines.

          <p>
            A UX designer with a lifelong love of asking questions like “why isn’t this easier?” 
            and “who thought this was a good idea?”

          <h3 id="ux-meaning-heading">What UX Design Means to Me</h3>
          <p>
            To me, UX design is the practice of making someone’s day smoother without them even noticing. 
            It’s anticipating needs before someone has to say them out loud. It’s that quiet little moment 
            when a person interacts with something and doesn’t get frustrated, confused, or stuck. That ease, 
            that satisfaction… is the mark of a design that did its job.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe UX thinking belongs in every part of the design process, because at its core, all designs 
            are created for someone. Whether it’s a product, a website, a logo, or a system, if it’s not built 
            around the person on the other side, it’s just decoration. In a world where technology is threaded 
            through almost every part of life, we don’t just have a responsibility to make things look good, 
            we have a responsibility to make them work for the people who rely on them.

        <!-- Curiosity -->
        <section aria-labelledby="curiosity-heading">
          <h3 id="curiosity-heading">Rooted in Curiosity</h3>
          <p>
            I grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a small city filled with potential where I learned how to balance 
            curiosity with commitment. I've always been the kind of person who wants to know how systems work, 
            how people think, and why something feels intuitive while something else feels clunky. That curiosity 
            drives me in design, but it also extends into the rest of my life. I have a deep love for the arts, 
            from drawing and illustration to photography or music, and it continues to fuel my creativity and 
            shape how I approach visual storytelling. Outside of the studio, I find energy in staying active and 
            engaged with the world around me, whether that means spending time outdoors, traveling to new places, 
            or taking on challenges that push me outside of my comfort zone. For me, growth is just as much about 
            experiencing life as it is about learning in the classroom. Every hike, concert, or cross-country 
            adventure shapes the way I see the world, and that perspective carries directly into my design work, 
            keeping it human-centered, dynamic, and grounded in lived experience.

        <!-- Experience -->
        <section aria-labelledby="learning-heading">
          <h3 id="learning-heading">Learning Through Experience</h3>
          <p>
            My academic journey has always been about blending creativity with real-world application.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Ivy Tech, I built a strong foundation in content creation and graphic design, skills that still shape my visual approach today. When I transferred to Indiana University, I leaned into media and development, exploring the technical side of how digital experiences are created, produced, and sustained.
          </p>
          <p>
            To grow beyond the classroom, I earned certifications in Multi-Device Development from Indiana University, Graphic Design from the California Institute of the Arts, and both UX Design and Digital Marketing from Google. This balance of artistry and technology became the backbone of my education, and it was strengthened through internships that challenged me to put theory into practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working throughout my degree shaped me as much as my classes did. Each role showed me how people interact with technology in different ways, and how design can either support or frustrate them. Through these experiences I came to a simple truth: good design is not just about how something looks. Good design is also about how it helps someone reach a goal, solve a problem, or simply move through their day with more ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my sophomore year at Indiana University, I was selected to participate in the "Semester in L.A." program, where I was immersed in the media industry while attending classes and working an internship. My semester in Los Angeles remains one of the most defining chapters of my journey. Balancing coursework and industry experience full-time taught me adaptability, independence, and collaboration in a way nothing else has. Those lessons continue to fuel the way I approach design today.

        <section aria-labelledby="swiss-heading">
          <h3 id="swiss-heading">The Swiss Army Knife Effect</h3>
          <p>
            I like to think of myself as a bit of a Swiss Army knife, shaped not only by my education but also by the winding path I took to get here.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated early from Carroll High School in Indiana, eager to begin experiencing life outside the classroom. In those first years I worked in restaurants and retail, moving quickly into management positions where I learned the value of leadership, adaptability, and staying steady in high-pressure environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the pandemic began, I shifted from an assistant manager role to working in IT and customer support. That experience opened my eyes to the world of technology and problem-solving through the perspective of the user. It was during that time that I began pursuing certifications, which ultimately led me to commit to a degree in media and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, I have had the privilege of leading digital campaigns, designing websites from the ground up, conducting user research, optimizing performance, and producing creative media including photography and video. I have also helped build CRM systems for brands that needed clarity and cohesion, experiences that taught me how design can make an organization more effective and human-centered.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I have carried with me through all of these roles is simple. No matter the industry, no matter the team, and no matter the project, the user is always at the heart of the work.

          <p>
            I also care deeply about community. I currently volunteer as a crisis counselor with Crisis Text Line and help 
            facilitate interactive learning at the Indiana State Museum. I enjoy spending a few weekends during the summer 
            helping local fairs and festivals wherever needed, and have taught basic economics to kindergartners through 
            Junior Achievement. Volunteering grounds me. It reminds me that beyond the pixels and platforms, there are real 
            people on the other side of every design decision with diverse experiences and abilities.
